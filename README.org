** Ben notes
Hero section -> logo, tagline (“Secure, Scalable, Innovative”), and a short call-to-action or contact us button.
About us -> short blurb about mission/vision + core values (knowledge, reliability, excellence, integrity).
Products/Services -> 3–4 cards:
Enterprise Systems (custom software)
Project Management Systems
Knowledge Base Systems
Training & Consultancy
Industries served -> healthcare, fintech, education, retail
Tech stack -> badges for Lisp, Nix, PostgreSQL.. etc
Contact -> form + email/phone, maybe a map
Footer -> links + socials

It’s basically: Hero -> About -> Services -> Industries -> Tech -> Contact -> Footer.
Clean one page flow but can expand later if needed
